# Wordle
A python script implementation of the classic word-guessing game, Wordle.

## Instructions
Users aim to guess a secret word with a specified number of attempts. After each guess, the program provides feedback using symbols (i.e., `!` for correct letters in the correct position, `?` for correct letters in the wrong position or a repeated correct letter in the correct position, and `*` for letters not in the word. The game ends when the player guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

## Application
This program offers an entertaining version of Wordle while establishing familiarity with the command-line.
